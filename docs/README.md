Trombone
========

Trombone is a JSON-driven data access server for PostgreSQL. Its chief purpose is to translate JSON-formatted HTTP requests to SQL statemets. 

You may find this software useful if;

1. your application infrastructure relies on relational SQL schemas; and
2. you need to expose JSON data through a RESTful web service.
